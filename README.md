# Appointment Concierge

Appointment Concierge is a demo application that allows a patient to record and send a voice message to his healthcare provider and request an appointment. The application uses Amazon Transcribe Medical to transform the voice message into text and Amazon Comprehend Medical to derive meaningful information. The information extracted from the message is used to generate an email for an appointment coordinator. Furthermore, message data is analysed and presented in a dashboard using the Amazon QuickSight service.
